# JSON command framing

The additional `encode-json` command consumes exactly one JSON document from
stdin. A streaming serde deserializer previously returned after the first value
without validating remaining bytes. It accepted a second value, garbage, NUL or
invalid UTF-8 after a complete object. Calling the maintained deserializer's
`end()` before encoding now rejects those suffixes while allowing ordinary
trailing JSON whitespace. Errors produce no binary stdout.

The 14-row native fixture uses protobuf3.21.12 JsonStringToMessage for Time. The
CLI test freshly replays each native complete status/output. Twelve rows compare
Rust/native success and complete output, including duplicate fields, trailing
ASCII whitespace, invalid input and comments. Two separate native-supported
syntax rows (unquoted keys and a trailing comma) were left as explicit grammar
obligations by the framing slice. The
standalone format commands are Rust additions, not original gz-msgs CLI options.
No complete JSON grammar, native diagnostic or formatting equivalence is claimed.

The earlier eight CLI tests and all original mappings remain unchanged. This
bounded correction changes no protobuf runtime, dependency or coverage exclusion.
Independent review and the full strict staged/hosted gate remain required.

`python3 scripts/json-reference.py` reproduces all 14 native outcomes and records
fixture/schema/helper/binary hashes without rewriting the golden data. The full
local follow-up gate passes 83 Rust checks, five snapshot regressions, archive QA
and clean downstream compilation: 1258/1258 owned lines and 1933/1945 regions. CLI
coverage is 61/61 lines and 123/127 regions. These include the preceding frozen
wire implementation; this packet itself adds one CLI check and no wire changes.
Matching final metadata, exact staged publication and hosted CI remain required.

Independent review reproduced all 14 native outcomes and the new Rust framing
test in a fresh reviewer-owned target. An initial replay in the producer's normal
target failed: its executable was compiled from the earlier wire snapshot, as
shown by debug compilation-directory provenance, and Cargo reported it Fresh.
That target had been shared with a reviewer build. The failing binary/logs were
retained locally; cleaning only this package's outputs and rebuilding restored
the correct executable. All nine CLI tests then passed, including the five
unchanged original C++ assertions. Source and assertions were not changed to
resolve the discrepancy. Reviewer targets must remain isolated from producer
targets; mtimes alone do not establish checked-source identity.

## Bare keys and trailing object commas

The next bounded correction quotes bare ASCII field-name tokens and removes a
trailing comma before an object close. It operates outside quoted strings and
leaves comments, repeated commas, array delimiters and trailing document bytes
for the existing deserializer to reject. Dynamic message decoding, duplicate
field behavior and the complete-document check remain in their existing order.

The two former grammar-gap rows now compare Rust and native output. A separate
15-row native fixture covers combined syntax, whitespace, duplicate fields and
malformed controls. `scripts/json-reference.py` replays all 29 source-bound
native rows. General protobuf JSON grammar and diagnostics remain unqualified;
the [independent review](reviews/json-grammar.json) approved this bounded
mapping after a private full test replay and additional lexical controls. The
normal staged hook and hosted qualification remain required.
